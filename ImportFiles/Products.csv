<b>Cutting Board Directions:</b><br>
Wash board with warm water and gentle soap. Dry thoroughly.<br>
Apply the oil directly onto the surface of the board.<br>
Be generous with application, especially if the wood is dry or the cutting board or butcher block is new.<br>
The surface should be dripping wet on all sides. We recommend using a small bar towel or new paint brush to spread the oil (try not to soak up the oil), as using your hands may lead to accidental splinters.<br>
Let the oil soak into the cutting board for as long as possible; at least a few hours, preferably overnight.<br>
Let your cutting board sit on a wire rack or upright to dry when done.<br>
If you are restoring an old, dry board or seasoning a new cutting board, you may wish to repeat this process to ensure your cutting board is completely seasoned.<br>
We recommend oiling your cutting board <b>every month</b> or when dry to the touch.<br><br>

It swells 15x times its mass, forming a strong water and chemical proof seal makes it an ideal, inexpensive, permanent, and easy to install a liner.<br><br>
Bentonite Clay Applications for pond and lake bottoms:<br>
For best results, drain your pond and mix bentonite clay into the soil of the pond bottom and sides, using 2 to 5 pounds per square foot depending on the characteristics of the soil.<br>
<b>CLAY-LIKE AND SILTY SOIL:</b> 2 lbs./square foot. <br>
<b>SANDY SOIL:</b> 4 lbs./square foot.<br>
<b>SOIL CONTAINING GRAVEL AND ROCK:</b> 5 pounds or more will be required to obtain a seal.<br><br>
Once the bentonite is applied, the soil should be tilled to mix the soil and bentonite and then compacted. A continuous blanket of bentonite can be applied to the soil and then carefully covered with clean soil or sand to prevent the clay from mobilizing into the water column.<br><br>
Our sodium bentonite is food grade with no additives, and is environmentally-friendly.<br><br>

<b>Directions:</b><br>
1. Wash your board with warm water and gentle soap and allow to dry. <br>
2. Once your cutting board is thoroughly dry, apply the oil directly onto the surface of the board. <br>
3.Be generous with the application, especially if the wood is dry or you just purchased the cutting board or butcher block.<br>
4. You want the surface to be dripping wet on all sides and we recommend using a small bar towel or new paint brush to 
spread the oil (try not to soak up the oil), as using your hands may lead to accidental splinters. <br>
5. Most importantly, let the oil soak into the cutting board for as long as possible; at least a few hours preferably overnight.<br>
6. Let your cutting board sit on a wire rack or upright to dry when done. <br>
7. If you are restoring an old, dry or seasoning a new cutting board, you may wish to repeat this process two more times, 
to ensure your cutting board is completely seasoned. <br><br>
We recommended you oil your cutting board every month  or when dry to the touch. <br>,<br>

This product is non-nano (no nano particles) meaning it is larger than 100 nanometers (nm) (approx. 170 nm) and it is safe for use in food and cosmetics. Be careful not to use smaller than 100 nm as that can be absorbed into the skin, possibly the blood, and at small enough size can be absorbed into the brain.

Years of research and testing and personal experience have gone into developing it.

It swells 15x times its mass, forming a strong water and chemical proof seal makes it an ideal, inexpensive, permanent, and easy to install a liner.<br><br>
Bentonite Clay Applications for pond and lake bottoms:<br>
For best results, drain your pond and mix bentonite clay into the soil of the pond bottom and sides, using 2 to 5 pounds per square foot depending on the characteristics of the soil.<br>
<b>CLAY-LIKE AND SILTY SOIL:</b> 2 lbs./square foot. <br>
<b>SANDY SOIL:</b> 4 lbs./square foot.<br>
<b>SOIL CONTAINING GRAVEL AND ROCK:</b> 5 pounds or more will be required to obtain a seal.<br><br>
Once the bentonite is applied, the soil should be tilled to mix the soil and bentonite and then compacted. A continuous blanket of bentonite can be applied to the soil and then carefully covered with clean soil or sand to prevent the clay from mobilizing into the water column.<br><br>
Our sodium bentonite is food grade with no additives, and is environmentally-friendly.<br><br>

<b>Cutting Board Directions:</b><br>
Wash board with warm water and gentle soap. Dry thoroughly.<br>
Apply the oil directly onto the surface of the board.<br>
Be generous with application, especially if the wood is dry or the cutting board or butcher block is new.<br>
The surface should be dripping wet on all sides. We recommend using a small bar towel or new paint brush to spread the oil (try not to soak up the oil), as using your hands may lead to accidental splinters.<br>
Let the oil soak into the cutting board for as long as possible; at least a few hours, preferably overnight.<br>
Let your cutting board sit on a wire rack or upright to dry when done.<br>
If you are restoring an old, dry board or seasoning a new cutting board, you may wish to repeat this process to ensure your cutting board is completely seasoned.<br>
We recommend oiling your cutting board <b>every month</b> or when dry to the touch.<br><br>

Kneed dough for 2-3 minutes, or until all the Cinnamon is completely incorporated. If dough is too wet, add more cinnamon. If dough is too dry, add more applesauce. Roll dough to ¼ inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out fun shapes. Using a toothpick, make a hole near the top of the ornament attaching a hook or ribbon. Bake at 200°F for 2 ½ hours. Allow ornaments to cool completely. Decorate if desired. Thread ribbon through the hole at the top or attach a hook and hang on the tree.
